Issues with following the 'mygroup' group, this was meant to sit in Html and go around features to group them together. 
Then moving them as a group in Javascript. I was able to group them and it looked correct (same as example) but would not move in JS. 
This was irrelevant of how many items I grouped, and what type of items I grouped. 
Instead created a 'class' to group items as I knew it had worked for the skin. 
Tested previously and was able to move skin as a group so knew this was a viable option.
